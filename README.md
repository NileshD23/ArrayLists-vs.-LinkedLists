# ArrayLists-vs.-LinkedLists
This was our third project that made us write functions for 
an ArrayList class and a LinkedList class. 
We then had to analyze the difference in run-times for said functions
in each class.
Refer to the PDF to view the tasks that were meant to be completed. 
All work should be in the respective java file(s).
